description: Welcome to the APIS PROJECT.

We are a collective of investigators and intelligence analysts dedicated to documenting harmful activities by state and non-state actors. Our expertise covers human rights violations, influence and information operations, dis/mis-information, and political developments in fragile and conflict-affected geographies. 

Our aim is to use open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools and methodologies to monitor harmful activities and expose those responsible for them.
