description: Welcome to the APIS PROJECT.

We are a collective of investigators and analysts dedicated to documenting harmful activities by state and non-state actors. Our expertise covers human rights violations, Foreign Information Manipulations and Interference (FIMI), and political developments in fragile and conflict-affected geographies.

Our mission is to use open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools and methodologies to monitor harmful activities and expose those responsible for them.

Got a tip or want to get in touch? Reach out to us via email at [apisproject@proton.me](mailto:apisproject@proton.me), on Bluesky @apisproject.bsky.social, or on X @apisproject_x.
