# Welcome to the Apis Project

We are a collective of investigators and analysts dedicated to documenting harmful activities by state and non-state actors. Our expertise covers human rights violations, Foreign Information Manipulations and Interference (FIMI), and political developments in fragile and conflict-affected geographies.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to use open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools and methodologies to monitor harmful activities and expose those responsible for them.
