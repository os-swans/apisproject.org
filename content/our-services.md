While our core mission focuses on documenting and exposing harmful practices by state and non-state actors, we also leverage our expertise to provide specialised services for organisations in high-risk environments.

With a proven track record working with international organisations, NGOs, and governments, our team offers:

## Enhanced Due Diligence Reports
In-depth investigations into entities linked to conflict zones, armed groups, or state actors.

## Strategic Trade Risk Assessments & Training
Identifying risks in dual-use goods supply chains, front companies, and sanction circumvention tactics, with tailored training for your teams.

## Red Flag Identification & Country Risk Briefings
Briefings on emerging threats, sanctions, and regional actors.

## Pre-Transaction Advisory for High-Risk Markets
Confidential reviews to support M&A, supply chain, and compliance decisions.

We also provide consulting and training services for media organisations, NGOs, and law enforcement, using our expertise in human rights and conflict analysis to offer actionable insights.
