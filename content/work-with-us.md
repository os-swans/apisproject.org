We are always open to collaborate with like-minded organisations and researchers.

While our core mission focuses on documenting and exposing harmful practices by state and non-state actors, we can also leverage our expertise to provide consulting and tailored training services for media organisations and NGOs, using our expertise of OSINT tools and methodologies to conduct human rights and conflict analysis.

Reach out at apisproject@proton.me or on any of our socials.
